This bot works under every OS that supports Python and Skype4Py: Among them are Linux, BSD, Windows and Mac.
I assume, you named the downloaded file bot.py


To run it, you need:

1. Skype and an account there

2. Installed and configured Python. It's easy to find out how.

3. Installed Skype4Py as a module for python. 
See: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Skype4Py/




Then do the following:

1. Edit the bot-file to fit your needs. 
Especially adapt the "Target Username" and your custom sets of answers.

2. Log in to Skype

3. Start my bot-file. 
In Linux, you can run it from a terminal. Move to the directory the file is located in and type:
python bot.py
This allows you to see some additional information, wich is not important to you at all.
If you want to be able to run it by mouse-click, not from a terminal, you need to configure your file-associations.
It's your task to find out how.
In Windows... Just don't use windows. But if you do: Just double-click the file.
In Mac OS â€“ I don't know how and I dont want to know.

4. Open the Skype window. There should have popped up a dialogue 
asking you to allow my bot acces to your Skype client. Of course, you agree.

5. Begin doing something more productive than responding to senseless messages.
